1.  I need to do lots of hardwork to survive in this masai journey.
2. I got very less marks in my unit evalution ,i can't tell much more about my current situation.
    i am feeling so much depressed as i am writing this note at 3:53 am .
3. I was a kind of so much extra extrovert in the begining of this journey 
    but i feel like unsafe when i intaract a little with anyone.
